# balloon-environmental-sensing

It's easy to do environmental sensing at ground level. But how about up in the air over our heads? If we could somehow reach it inexpensively and safely, can we directly explore what lies above, perhaps making our own discoveries?

Use this MicroPython code with a Pycom LoPy4 or FiPy to create a party-balloon platform for inexpensive aerial environmental sensing. Everyday balloons offer a number of advantages. They are readily available and very safe to fly. They don't cost much or require any licensing, training or piloting skills. Balloons don't use any fuel or batteries, yet they can stay aloft for days at a time, silently. When tethered, it's easy to control their height and position in space and they're quite environmentally friendly. Balloon lofting is perfect for children's science programs, hacker workshops, citizen science research, digital naturalism, technology art, and low-cost indoor or industrial monitoring.
